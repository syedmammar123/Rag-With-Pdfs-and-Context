    You are an agricultural expert with deep knowledge of {crop} farming in {location}.
    Your task is to generate an extremely detailed, 2-week {crop} farming guide starting from {start_date} to two weeks from this data(basically 2 upcoming weeks in total).

    This is not a simple summary. Write as if you are explaining to a farmer who will follow every word of your guide.
    The response should be like a full textbook or an agricultural manual, covering everything in-depth.

    ### Current Soil Conditions:
    - **NPK Levels:** N: {soil_data["NPK"]["N"]}, P: {soil_data["NPK"]["P"]}, K: {soil_data["NPK"]["K"]}
    - **Soil Temperature:** {soil_data["soil_temperature"]}
    - **Soil Moisture:** {soil_data["soil_moisture"]}
    - **Conductivity:** {soil_data["conductivity"]}
    - **pH Level:** {soil_data["pH"]}

    ### Weather Forecast for the Next 2 Weeks:
    {weather_forecast}

    The farming plan should be structured as:
    1. Week Number & Dates (e.g., Week 1: March 1st - March 7th)
    2. Daily Plan for Each Week (Monday-Sunday)
    3. Comprehensive Tasks for Each Day (Not just one-liners. Explain every detail.)
    4. Why Each Task is Important (Scientific reason + real-world examples)
    5. How to Do Each Task Properly (Step-by-step guidance)

    At the end of each week, reflect on the progress and adjustments needed for the next week.

    Now, think carefully.

    For each week, go through the following steps before answering:

    1. Break the week into daily tasks and think: "What does the farmer need to do on each day?"
    2. For each task, ask yourself:
    - What are the exact steps?
    - What tools or materials are needed?
    - What could go wrong, and how to fix it?
    - What is the scientific reason behind this task?
    - How will this task affect the next steps?

    3. Expand and Explain Every Detail
    - If the farmer is watering, specify how much water (in mm) and best time to water (morning/evening).
    - If applying fertilizer, mention which type (organic or synthetic), exact dosage, and method (broadcast, foliar spray, etc.).
    - If checking for pests, list which pests are common this week, how to identify them, and treatment methods (organic & chemical).

    The response should be in **JSON format**, structured like this:

    {{
    "week_1": {{
        "dates": "{start_date} ",
        "tasks": {{
        "Monday": {{

    "week_2": {{ ... }}
    }}

    The properly drafted plan was actually this, so please look into it while writing your answer. Our current week is {week_number}.


    Below is what happened in the last two weeks:
    {previous_data}

    The current week is Week {week_number}. The data below is what is supposed to happen in the upcoming two weeks:

def FetchEntire():
    queryForEntire = """Role & Context:
    You are an agriculture expert. Your task is to generate a high-level, week-wise farming plan for a given crop, location, and starting date. The plan should outline the expected growth stages and key activities for each week without daily breakdowns or detailed instructions.

    Instructions:
    - Dynamically determine the starting date, location, and crop based on the input.
    - Only provide an overview of tasks for each week.
    - Consider real-time factors such as temperature ({temperature}Â°C), NPK levels (N: {N}, P: {P}, K: {K}), and soil conditions.

    Response Format:
    The response should be in JSON format with the following structure:
    {{
    "week_1": {{
        "growth_stage": "Germination & Early Growth",
        "key_activities": "This week, you will focus on sowing seeds and ensuring proper initial irrigation. Keep an eye on soil moisture and maintain an optimal temperature of around {temperature}Â°C to support germination."
    }},
    "week_2": {{
        "growth_stage": "Root Establishment",
        "key_activities": "The seedlings will start developing stronger roots. Apply early-stage fertilizers based on NPK levels (N: {N}, P: {P}, K: {K}) to promote healthy growth. Weed control is also essential at this stage to prevent competition for nutrients."
    }},
    "...": "...",
    "week_n": {{
        "growth_stage": "Harvest & Post-Harvest Management",
        "key_activities": "Your crop is now ready for harvest. Ensure you pick the crop at optimal maturity for the best yield. After harvesting, focus on proper storage and residue management to maintain quality."
    }}
    }}

    Additional Guidelines:
    - Growth stage â The general phase of crop development.
    - Key activities â A short summary of the most important actions.

    This should be a broad timeline for the entire farming cycle. After this, we will regenerate detailed tasks for the current and next week based on real-time data.

    Here is some real-time context about how the crop timeline really looks like:
    {output}

    Now, generate the full week-wise farming plan for the given input. Return answer in pure JSON, not as a string!
